    heading: Introduction to ShaderGraph
    richText: "In previous versions of Unity, the only way to create specialized
      Materials was to program a custom shader or use an outside plugin. With the
      release of 2018, Unity now has its own native Shader Graph, which can be used
      to build visually complex Materials using nodes.\nUnlike the process of writing
      code, saving, compiling, and testing in the Editor, the Shader Graph shows
      you what\u2019s happening to the Material in real-time, allowing you to make
      changes and experiment on the fly.\n"
