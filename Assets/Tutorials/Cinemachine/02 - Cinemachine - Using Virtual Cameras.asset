    richText: 'In your project, organize your Scene Hierarchy to have a single Unity
      camera with a CinemachineBrain component and many Virtual Cameras.


      To
      add a <color=red> Virtual Camera </color>to a Scene:


      In the Unity menu,
      choose <b>GameObject > Cinemachine > Virtual Camera.</b>

      Unity adds
      a new GameObject with a Cinemachine Virtual Camera component. If necessary,
      Unity also adds a Cinemachine Brain component to the Unity camera GameObject
      for you.


      Use the <b>Follow</b> property to specify a GameObject to
      follow.

      The Virtual Camera automatically positions the Unity camera
      relative to this GameObject at all times, even as you move it in the Scene.


      Use
      the <b>Look At</b> property to specify the GameObject that the Virtual Camera
      should aim at.

      The Virtual Camera automatically rotates the Unity camera
      to face this GameObject at all times, even as you move it in the Scene.


      Customize
      the Virtual Camera as needed.

      Choose the algorithm for following and
      looking at, and adjust settings such as the follow offset, the follow damping,
      the screen composition, and the damping used when re-aiming the camera.
